NEIU-Research
=============

Northeastern Illinois University Internet Topology Research was a research project done in the summer of 2014. The members of the research group were Dr. Graciela Perera, Bonnie Tongs, Charla Earls, Michael Abreu, and Karl Amjad-Ali. Our research was aimed at updating the findings of previous research done in 2008 by Gill, et al. [1].

Files
=============

Summary of files in project:
  - The <b>data</b> folder contains all data files collected during our research. These files are in xml format.
  - The <b>Data Automation Program</b> is the tool we used to collect traceroute data from public traceroute servers. This tool was written in Java. No GUI was made for our tool because we were pressed for time. The tool can be reconfigured easily using the two text files:
    - <b>Data Automation Program / Collection / config / </b> source.txt
    - <b>Data Automation Program / Collection / config / </b> destination.txt

Installation
=============

Download the files. Open a command prompt that has Java installed to its PATH variable. Navigate into 'Data Automation Program' and run the command: <b>java -jar "Data Automation Program.jar"</b>
